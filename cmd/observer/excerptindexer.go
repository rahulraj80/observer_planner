// output build their indexer here, so the switch governs both writers the

// place and skips only the FTS5 excerpt insert.
//
// Before this seam the hook processes built an indexer unconditionally, so a
// node that turned indexing off still grew action_excerpts from every
// cursor postToolUse / stop event while the watcher wrote nothing.
