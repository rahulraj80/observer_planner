// projects_judge_wire.go adapts alignmentJudgeFor (W5a,
// cmd/observer/alignment_wire.go) into the dashapi.Options.JudgeGrade
// shape. Build-tag-split from projects_wire.go because alignmentJudgeFor
// uses the judge client component (judge_wire.go, internal/judgeclient),
// which a `-tags sbo_omit_judge_client` build compiles out; see
// projects_judge_wire_stub.go for that side. It no longer depends on obs
// (phase PB moved the judge client out of obs_wire.go, D-408 / D-424).

// projectsJudgeGradeSeam returns a closure that grades one prompt's
// alignment.Input through the configured judge, or nil with the honest
// reason alignmentJudgeFor gave (disabled config / no model configured)
// when the tier cannot run.
