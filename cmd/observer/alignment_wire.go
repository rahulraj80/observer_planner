// alignment.EgressGate (JUDGE-1, docs/security.md): baseURL and orgPinned
// are captured once at construction (alignmentJudgeFor runs once per
// process, not per grading call) and combined with the PER-CALL
// alignment.Input.Authority — the only fact that changes from one grading
// call to the next — inside AllowInput.

	// safe proxy here, because this adapter (unlike
	// obsBuildJudge/obsBuildAdmissionJudge) does not actually implement
	// relay routing, so treating UseOrgRelay=true as "org-pinned" would
	// let org-authority content reach the OpenRouter default instead of
	// the org's own relay — the opposite of what org-pinned is meant to
	// assert. Wiring a real signal (e.g. internal/policyfam/nodegov's
	// readEffectivePins() over "observability.judge.*", or giving this
	// adapter genuine relay support first) is a documented follow-up.

// found nothing) — dataauthority's own convention is that an unknown
// authority is treated exactly like AuthorityOrg (see
// EligibleForOrgEnrichment's doc comment: "an unknown authority ... is
// refused too"). This gate follows that same convention rather than
// fail-open: an empty in.Authority is passed through to
// JudgeEgressAllowed as dataauthority.Authority(""), which its own
// decision table already treats as "AuthorityOrg or unknown" — allowed
// only over loopback or an org-pinned config, refused otherwise. This

//     the same resolveJudgeConfig precedence obsBuildJudge/
//     obsBuildAdmissionJudge use) has no model configured: there is

// When a judge IS configured, the base URL decides hosting exactly the
// way it does for the eval/admission judges (judgeHostingLabel): a
// loopback base_url is treated as no-egress and sent unmodified; anything
// else gets secureJudgeEgress's guardrails (secret-redact + payload cap)
