// Per-tool / per-model budget warnings (Sol A5-04, D-011 + D-016).
//
// The org's subject caps are ENFORCED by the guard against the accounting
// owner's ByTool / ByModel totals, but the warning service only ever saw the
// whole-caller Origins, so a $10/day cap on one tool could deny at $10 with no
// warning at $7.50 or $9. The warning ladder now walks every subject cap too,
// measured against the SAME accounting the guard enforces with.
//
// ONE ACCOUNTING OWNER. The guard does not expose its per-subject totals, and
// a second spend query would be a second truth that could disagree with the
// enforcement number. So guardwire registers the exact accounting lookup it
// installs on the guard (registerProcessBudgetAccounting), and the warning
// service reads ByTool / ByModel through that same function, with the same
// calendars the composed engine uses, keyed by the same resolved subject id
// (orgbudget.SubjectCap.ID is folded through the guard's subject resolver at
// composition).

// installed on the process guard.
