// remoteconsent.go holds the two signed records of the SuperBased package
// lookup (OS and CI vulnerability scanning plan sections 13.4, 13.10 and
// 13.11, lane RM-2): instead of downloading the OSV databases, a node in
// lookup mode "remote" (or "both", for the ecosystems with no local
// database) asks SuperBased for the advisory shards its packages fall in.
//
//   - RemoteConsent (osv-remote-consent.json) is the lookup itself: what
//     leaves the machine is a short hash prefix per package name, never a
//     name, a version or code. It is its own record, never the database
//     accept and never the install gate's disclosure.
//   - RemotePrivateConsent (osv-remote-private-consent.json) is the separate
//     choice to look up private and internal package names too: sending
//     them never rides the lookup consent.
//
// Both have the shape and signing of Consent (guardposture.RecordMAC under
// the node's posture key, each with its own MAC domain and version), are
// given only on the dashboard or the CLI, never by an agent (guard rule
// R-165 denies the verbs, the posture route and a write to either record),
// and can be withdrawn: WithdrawRemoteConsent and WithdrawRemotePrivate
// remove the record, which takes effect at the next lookup. A managed node
// has nothing to accept: its organization decides the lookup posture.
//
// The records live here, beside the other accepts, so every reader (the
// scan command, the status lines, the dashboard seam) reads them without
// linking the lookup lane (internal/secscan/osvshard/shardnet, the
// security.scan.osv.shards egress lane). RemoteShardHost is that lane's one
// allow-listed host; its test pins that RemoteConsentText names it.

// RemoteConsentVersion is bumped when RemoteConsentText changes materially;
// a record of an older version reads not accepted.
