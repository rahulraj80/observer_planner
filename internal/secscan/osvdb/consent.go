// consent.go is the developer's one-time accept of the OSV database
// download (operator ruling PT-19 (2), decision log P-036): nothing is
// downloaded into the store until the developer accepts, once, in the
// dashboard (a confirm dialog that shows the size and the source) or the
// CLI (`observer security scan db accept`); after that the refreshes are
// automatic. The record is node-local and kept beside the online checks'
// disclosure record in the security directory, so deleting the database
// store to reclaim space does not ask again. An agent can never give the
// accept: guard rule R-165 denies the CLI verb, its HTTP route and a write
// to the record file, and the record is signed under the node's posture
// key (guardposture.RecordMAC), so a hand-written file reads not accepted
// (lane sec-deps4 audit finding 1). A record an earlier plan-branch build
// wrote carries no MAC and reads not accepted, so a tester accepts once
// more; no released build ever wrote one.

// ConsentVersion is bumped when the accept text changes materially (a new
// source, a much larger download); a record of an older version reads not
// accepted, so the developer is asked again.
//
// Version 2 (2026-11-03, static feed mirroring plan section 8): the
// databases come from SuperBased's signed mirror on superbased.app first,
// with the OSV bucket as the fallback, so every individual node is asked
// once more.

// joined the mirror: the fifteen exports' Content-Length on the OSV bucket
// that day sum to 307.0 MB (the nine earlier ones 303.8 MB, the six new
// ones 3.2 MB together, Julia's 2.1 MB the largest of them), so "about
// 300 MB" still holds and the accept text (which names no ecosystem, so
// it covers every one the store downloads) needs no new version: a node
// that accepted already fetches the new ecosystems on its next refresh.
// TestApproxDownloadMBHonest holds the sum.
