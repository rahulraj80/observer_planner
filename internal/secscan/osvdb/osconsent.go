// osconsent.go is the developer's one accept of the OS release databases
// (OS and CI vulnerability scanning plan section 6.4, operator ruling Q1
// (b), section 6.6.1 change 2): one accept covers every distribution
// release the developer's scanned images use, each fetched on demand from
// SuperBased's signed mirror on superbased.app only (the
// security.osv_os_export content kind; there is no bucket fallback for OS
// databases). It is a separate signed record beside the language accept
// (ConsentFile), with its own MAC domain and version, so the language
// accept's ConsentVersion is not bumped and nobody is asked again for the
// languages. Like the language accept it is given only on the dashboard or
// with `observer security scan db accept --os`, never by an agent (guard
// rule R-165 denies the verb, the route and a write to the record), and a
// managed node has nothing to accept: its OS databases come from its org
