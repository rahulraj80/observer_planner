// index read/write surface and the resolve / semantic passes are not linked.
// The per-project delete and the retention prune stay (codeintelprune.go).
// These are the two derived-data passes an archive rehydrate asks for; they
// refuse, so a rehydrated project is reported as needing a re-index by a
// build that has the component.
