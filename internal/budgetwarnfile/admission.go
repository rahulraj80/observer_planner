// THE HOOK-PATH BUDGET ADMISSION FILE (T-519, D-332).
//
// An exhausted organization hard budget used to stop only the work Observer
// could see on its own transport: proxied requests (the guard's proxy check),
// launches (the launch gate) and the processes the node can bind by exact
// executable identity (the process controller). A tool whose model calls go to
// its vendor directly, and whose process the controller could not bind (Cursor
// on the demo estate: a shell-script launcher that execs a bundled node), kept
// answering prompts at 133% of a blocking cap. Its pre-send hooks fired on every
// prompt and every tool call, and answered allow, because a hook process never
// measured spend (the lookup lives in the daemon, and a per-call managed spend
// read would cost a second or more inside the vendor's hook timeout).
//
// This file is how the hook path gets the SAME decision without measuring
// anything: the daemon publishes the managed budget decision the process
// controller and the launch gate already ask (guard.CheckInterventionBudget,
// one owner for the number), and every hook process reads it with one small
// file read before its reply. It is a decision, not a warning, so it lives
// beside budget-status.json rather than inside it: the warning file is
// rewritten on the warn ladder's cadence and keeps its last evaluation when a
// measurement is unavailable, which is the right rule for a warning and the
// wrong one for a stop.
//
// Ownership (CLAUDE.md #4): ONE writer, the daemon's budget service
// (cmd/observer/budgetwarn_wire.go publishAdmission). Hook processes only read.

// AdmissionFilename is the basename, placed beside the DB (the same placement
// rule as budget-status.json, so a cross-OS hook bridge resolves the same
// file).
