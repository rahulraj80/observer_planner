// Package localipc is the owner-only local IPC transport (lane MP-L1K,
// T-715): an AF_UNIX socket under a 0700 directory on unix, a named pipe
// with a protected owner-only DACL on Windows, honestly unsupported
// elsewhere. It moved out of internal/attachsock (which re-exports it) so the
// MCP relay's IPC (internal/mcprelay) and the terminals component's attach
// channel share one transport, and a build without terminals keeps the
// relay's IPC. The endpoint naming and error strings are unchanged.
