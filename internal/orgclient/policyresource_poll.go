// PolicyResourceSelectorCapability is the capability token this agent
// advertises on every GET /api/agent/policy/{family} — the design's R2
// mixed-fleet compatibility gate
// (docs/plans/policy-targeting-rollback-design-2026-08-13.md §8 R2).
//
// Pre-P0-10 agents reject EVERY targeted envelope outright (their closed-
// envelope gate required selectors_json == "{}"), so the server must only
// serve a targeted resource to a subject that positively advertises it can
// evaluate selectors. The marker grants nothing: the server still resolves
// the audience from attributes bound to the verified identity, not from
// anything the fetching node presents, and claiming it falsely only makes the
// agent reject envelopes it cannot evaluate. It is NOT simply downgrade-only,
// though: omitting it can turn a delivery into "no applicable policy", which
// since the signed withdrawal (D-192) may be a signed tombstone. The server
// therefore re-resolves a marker-less request as selector capable and
// withdraws only when that finds nothing either (C156-17).

// including the R2 capability marker. It is the ONE place that URL is
// composed (receivePolicyResource calls it), so the marker can never be
// present on one code path and missing on another.
//
// The other markers are the node.governance target (nodegov.CapabilityTokens:
// the section vocabulary level, the highest body schema and the key
// vocabulary generation this build compiles): the server projects the body it
// serves onto exactly that, so a page, schema or pinned key only newer builds
// have never costs this node the rest of its governance. They ride as
// repeated values so a server reading only the first policy_caps value still
// sees "selectors", and a server that predates a token ignores it. The last
// marker asks for a v2 (org-, member- and target-bound) signature
// (orgcontract.PolicyBindingCapability); a server that predates it keeps
// serving v1.
