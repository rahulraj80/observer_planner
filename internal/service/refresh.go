// refresh.go is the decision `observer service install --now` and
// `observer service upgrade` make about an ALREADY RUNNING unit after they
// rewrite it (T-753). The rc.3 roll found that an in-place upgrade (the
// installer, or npm) replaced the binary underneath a running daemon and then
// reported the service as started: the old process kept running the deleted
// executable until someone restarted it by hand.
//
// The daemon IS the proxy, so a restart is only automatic when nothing can be
// routing through it (CLAUDE.md "never stop the daemon while the proxy route
// is active", docs/daemon-restart-runbook.md). Otherwise the caller prints
// the safe order and leaves the old process running. The decision is a data
// table walked top-down; the cmd layer gathers the inputs (systemctl, /proc,
// the route registrars) and performs the action.
