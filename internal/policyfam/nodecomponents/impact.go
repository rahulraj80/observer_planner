// impact.go is the org-side reading of what a node.components policy means
// for the fleet as the nodes reported it (T-777, D-617): which components a
// published (or draft) policy requires, allows, denies or leaves off; which
// components the managed nodes actually run; and which running components a
// draft would turn off. The org server reads the posture rows
// (org_node_component_posture) and hands them here as NodeReport values; the
// decisions are made by the ONE resolver (components.Resolve), never by a
// second copy of its rules.
//
// Honesty rules:
//   - a node reports only its NON-active components one by one; the active
//     set is a digest. The running set is derived as "every node row of this
//     catalog minus the reported inactive ids" and is trusted only when its
//     digest equals the reported active digest (same catalog version too).
//     A node whose derivation does not verify is counted as unchecked, never
//     as running or as fine;
//   - the developer's own selection is not on the wire. A component a node
//     runs today only because the org pins or requires it, and that a draft
//     merely allows, keeps running only if the developer's selection keeps
//     it: that is reported as "may stop", never as a certain loss or a
//     certain keep.
