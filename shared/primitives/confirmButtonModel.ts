// does in each state, and where the armed note goes.

// The placement rule this file owns: the armed note is NEVER laid out in the
// button's own flow. It floats (position: fixed, portalled, anchored under the
// button), so arming cannot move the button. Before 2026-11-04 the note was an
// inline sibling of the button: arming widened the control, a right-aligned
// or narrow container pushed the button sideways, and a quick second click
// landed where the button used to be and missed (seen on web2 Integrations >
// Identities "Link").
