#!/usr/bin/env bash
# restart-daemon.sh — safely restart the Observer daemon when AI clients
# route their API traffic through the proxy (ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL → :PORT).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (2026-06-20 burn): the daemon IS the proxy. If you kill
# it while a live Claude Code / Codex session points ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL /
# codex base_url at :PORT, that session's next API call dies with
# ConnectionRefused — including the very session running the restart.
# The safe order, per the operator's rule, is:
#
#     route OFF  →  restart daemon  →  route ON
#
# This script does the whole thing as ONE atomic run (sub-second proxy
# downtime), so no inter-turn API call lands in the down-window, and it
# flips the claude-code route off first as belt-and-suspenders.
#
# SESSIONS LAUNCHED BY THE DAEMON (2026-09-02 burn): a session started
# through a launcher (`observer claude`, `observer codex`, a dashboard
# terminal) is a process-tree DESCENDANT of the daemon. SIGTERM to the
# daemon then takes THIS script down mid-relaunch, leaving `db.Open: ping:
# context canceled` in the log and the route restored onto a dead port. So
# the script DETECTS that case (ancestry walk of the :PORT listener pid +
# the OBSERVER_DAEMON_CHILD marker) and REFUSES by default: the daemon owns
# the pty of every dashboard terminal / launcher session (internal/termsession),
# so stopping it kills that whole session — Claude Code included — even though
# a detached re-exec of this script survives and completes the restart
# (seen 2026-09-03: the relaunch succeeded, the operator's session was gone).
# `--detach` opts IN to that trade (setsid nohup … --detached; the restart
# completes, THIS session dies); `--detached` is the internal re-entry marker.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/restart-daemon.sh                       # plain safe restart
#   scripts/restart-daemon.sh --build               # `go build` the binary first, then restart
#   scripts/restart-daemon.sh --compression on      # enable conversation compression, then restart
#   scripts/restart-daemon.sh --compression off     # disable it, then restart
#   scripts/restart-daemon.sh --no-route-toggle     # don't touch settings.json (rely on atomic relaunch only)
#   scripts/restart-daemon.sh --detach              # daemon-launched session: restart detached anyway (THIS session will be killed)
#   scripts/restart-daemon.sh --no-detach           # (default) refuse when daemon-launched instead of killing the session
#   scripts/restart-daemon.sh --dry-run             # print the plan (incl. the detach decision) and exit
#   scripts/restart-daemon.sh --port 8820
#   scripts/restart-daemon.sh --stop-timeout 30     # seconds to wait for the old pid to EXIT before SIGKILL (default 30)
#   scripts/restart-daemon.sh --log /tmp/obs.log    # where the relaunched daemon's output goes (default /tmp/obs.log)
#   scripts/restart-daemon.sh --db PATH             # the daemon's DB (default: observer.db beside the config)
#
# Idempotent and conservative: backs up every file it edits, never uses
# `pgrep observer` (that self-matches the caller's argv), finds the daemon
# by the listening :PORT socket AND by every live `observer start` process
# that still owns the DB (its observer-<pid>.lock beside the DB, or an open
# handle on the DB file), and restores the route even on failure paths.
#
# NEVER TWO WRITERS (T-553, 2026-10-06 burn): a daemon releases its port
# early in its stop and can keep running (DB open) after that, so "the port
# is free" is not "the old daemon is gone". The script waits for the old PID
# itself to exit, bounded by --stop-timeout, escalates to SIGKILL with a
# clear log line when the bound passes (SQLite's WAL makes that safe), and
# relaunches only once the old pid is confirmed gone. The daemon bounds its
# own stop at 20s and names what blocked it, so the SIGKILL is a backstop.
# A daemon that is ALREADY stopping (a dashboard restart, a manual SIGTERM)
# has no listener left to find, so the script also finds it by its lock file
# and by its open DB handle (P3-06, the D-349 second writer) and applies the
# same wait / SIGKILL ladder to it before the relaunch.
