#!/usr/bin/env bash
# go-test-shards.sh - deterministically split the Go test-package universe into
# N balanced shards so CI can run `go test -race` in parallel jobs.
#
# Why this exists: ci.yml's `go` job ran the whole race suite as ONE step
# (`go test -race -timeout 40m ./...`). By 2026-09-16 that step took 5+ hours on
# the 2-core private-repo runner and hit GitHub's hard 6 h job cap on three
# consecutive pushes - the job was killed with no useful signal, so CI stopped
# being a gate at all. Splitting the suite across matrix shards puts every
# shard under a 120 min job timeout, and a failure now points at a package
# instead of at a stopwatch. The shard count is not fixed: ci.yml's plan job
# sizes it per run with `plan <max> <target>` (1 to 12 shards, D-609).
#
# The assignment is a plain LPT (longest-processing-time-first) greedy:
#   sort packages by weight DESC, then import path ASC (stable + reproducible),
#   then hand each package to whichever shard currently has the lowest running
#   total (ties -> lowest shard index).
# Because the input order is total and the rule is deterministic, every runner
# computes the same assignment from the same checkout and the same SHARD_FILTER
# file (which ci.yml's plan job hands every shard as the test-plan artifact) -
# no other coordination between jobs.
#
# Weights come from scripts/ci/go-test-weights.tsv (module-relative path TAB
# integer seconds). They are a BALANCING HEURISTIC ONLY. A package missing from
# the table gets a default weight, and a stale table makes the shards uneven -
# it can never make a package disappear, because the package universe is
# recomputed from `go list` on every invocation. That correctness property is
# what `check` asserts in CI.
#
# Modes:
#   list <index> <count>     space-separated import paths for one shard (stdout,
#                            nothing else - scripts/ci/go-test-run.sh reads it
#                            and splits it into its -race and plain halves)
#   plan <max> <target>      how many shards (1..max) the filtered universe
#                            needs to stay near <target> package-seconds each
#   check <count>            run the whole assignment, assert union == universe,
#                            no duplicates, no empty shard; print a per-shard
#                            summary. This is the honesty gate: a sharder bug
#                            that silently drops a package turns into a red job
#                            rather than into a test that stopped running.
#   weights <job-log-file>   regenerate the weight table from a real GitHub
#                            Actions job log:
#                              scripts/ci/go-test-shards.sh weights job.log \
#                                > scripts/ci/go-test-weights.tsv
#
# Pure bash + awk + sort + go. No python, no jq (the runner image is not
# guaranteed to carry either for this job).
