// configSave.ts is the save model of a settings card that edits a draft of
// one config block and saves it with one PUT (Settings > Sandbox isolation;
// live check D-5). It is pure: the card owns the state and the requests, and
// this file decides what the state becomes on each event.
//
// Two defects it closes:
//
//   - A save whose PUT returned 200 still read "Unsaved changes". The card
//     compared the draft against the last GET and relied on a reload after
//     the save; the shared query cache joins a GET already in flight, so that
//     reload could hand back the pre-save response. Now a save adopts the
//     PUT's own response (the saved block and the new etag) as the baseline,
//     and a read still carrying an etag a save superseded is ignored.
//   - A save could start from a stale closure. The card reads the state from
//     one place (a ref over this state) when Save is clicked, and a save that
//     cannot start says why instead of doing nothing.
