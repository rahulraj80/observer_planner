// guiLaunchCopy is the USER-FACING copy for an IDE / desktop-app (GUI) row in
// the New terminal dialog, derived from STRUCTURED fields only — never from
// free text.
//
// Why: gui_launchables rows also carry `note` and `wrap_reason`, and launch /
// preflight replies carry `wrap_note` / `notes`. Those are engineering records
// (install-layout provenance with dates and paths, base-URL research, WSLENV
// mechanics). They stay on the wire for `observer adapters` / doctor; the
// dialog shows only the short sentences below.
//
// The routing sentence is honest by construction: it is phrased from the
// daemon's own routing verdict (`routing_reaches_app` + `routing_reason`, the
// launcher's guilaunch.Compose result dry-run in the preflight, and the real
// one on the launch reply). Without a verdict, a sentence is shown ONLY for a
// wrap kind whose outcome does not depend on the machine — the dialog never
// claims routing it cannot deliver (a WSL daemon launching a Windows app is
// exactly the case where a child-env wrap silently does nothing).
//
// Table-driven (CLAUDE.md #5). Unknown kinds / reasons say nothing rather than
// echoing server text. No imports besides `import type`, so it runs under the
// node test runner.
