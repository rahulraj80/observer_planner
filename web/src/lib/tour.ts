// First-run guided tour — step data + types.

// A single linear walkthrough of the dashboard's key sections. Each step
// either anchors to a real UI element (via a `data-tour` selector) or
// renders a centered card (no target). Bodies are plain strings, rendered
// as text nodes only — never dangerouslySetInnerHTML — so the copy can
// never become an injection surface.

// The step type is shared with the org dashboard's tour (T-447).
