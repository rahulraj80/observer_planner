// navCounts.ts: the sidebar's count badges (the number in each nav row's
// right gutter), derived from one GET /api/status snapshot. Pure, so the
// Sidebar renders what this returns and the node tests pin it.
//
// Every Monitor, Analyze and Optimize page carries a badge, except the ones
// in UNBADGED_NAV_IDS (each with its reason). The Configure group stays
// unbadged: its pages hold settings, not records (Messages keeps its own
// unread badge, drawn by the Sidebar from the messages summary).
//
// Most badges are lifetime row counts; the ones that are not say so in
// their title (Live: the last 15 minutes, Overview: the last 24 hours,
// Code security: issues open now). A count the daemon did not send (an
// older daemon, or a build without the module) has no entry, so its badge
// hides instead of showing a bogus 0.
